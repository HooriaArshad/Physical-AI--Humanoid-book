# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## Overview
NVIDIA Isaac provides GPU-accelerated tools for robotic perception, simulation, and deployment. It bridges the gap between research-grade AI and production robotics by offering optimized pipelines for visual SLAM, navigation, and manipulation. This module covers Isaac's core capabilities for humanoid robotics.

## Key Topics
- **Photorealistic Simulation**: Synthetic environments for training AI models.
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Automated labeling for vision-based learning.
- **Visual SLAM & Navigation**: Real-time mapping and localization.
- **Path Planning for Humanoids**: Bipedal locomotion strategies.
- **Hardware Acceleration**: GPU-based inference for perception and control.
- **Integration with Digital Twins**: Testing AI in simulation before deployment.

## Capstone/Project
- Train a humanoid navigation AI:
  - Use Isaac Sim to generate data
  - Implement SLAM for environment mapping
  - Plan and execute walking paths avoiding obstacles
