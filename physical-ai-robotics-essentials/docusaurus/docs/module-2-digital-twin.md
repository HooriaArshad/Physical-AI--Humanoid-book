# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview
Before deploying code to physical hardware, roboticists validate behavior in simulation. Digital twins replicate the robot and its environment with sufficient fidelity to transfer learned behaviors to the real world. This module covers physics simulation fundamentals and high-fidelity rendering pipelines.

## Key Topics
- **Physics Simulation**: Gravity, friction, and collision handling.
- **Gazebo Plugins**: Adding sensors and actuators for testing.
- **Unity High-Fidelity Rendering**: Visual realism for human-robot interaction studies.
- **Sensor Simulation**:
  - LiDAR & Depth Cameras
  - IMUs for motion tracking
- **Scene & Environment Building**: Custom terrain, objects, and obstacles.
- **Integration with ROS 2**: Control simulated robots with ROS topics and services.

## Capstone/Project
- Create a Gazebo or Unity-based humanoid simulation:
  - Implement sensors and joint actuators
  - Test motion planning and obstacle avoidance
  - Export results to compare with real-world robot
